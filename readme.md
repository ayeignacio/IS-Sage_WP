<h1>Notes on files</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Please review the header menu. Too many classes you requested, but can't be fitted into menu without enlarging and bulking up the header.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Moved all of the classes under Classes tab instead.
	</ul>
	<li>Should give you rough idea of what the website will look like. Everything else is mostly finished. Didn't have enough time to finish adding in whatever else you needed, i.e. Menu items, slideshow items.
	<li>Really can't keep doing this kind of work at the rate we've discussed, especially if Sage is unwilling to hand over information to provide theme and files associated with it (which should have been requested in the first place to bypass this song and dance).</li>
	<li>Have a good week.</li>
