We’ve brought these experiences from your admin and re-created them right here on WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>Theme Directory</h3>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">Theme Directory</a> has a better browsing experience, with handy tabs where you can view featured, popular, and the latest themes. As with the theme experience in your admin, you can use the feature filter to browse for just the right theme for your WordPress website.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3572" src="https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/theme-directory-1024x768.png" alt="theme-directory" width="692" height="519" /></p>\n<p>Click on a theme to get more information about it, including shiny screenshots, ratings, and statistics.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3573" src="https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/theme-directory-individual-1024x768.png" alt="theme-directory-individual" width="692" height="519" /></p>\n<p>Konstantin Obenland <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/10/new-theme-directory/">posted a good overview</a> of everything involved with the theme directory overhaul and followed up with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/31/theme-directory-stats/">a post on improved statistics</a>.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Directory</h3>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">Plugin Directory</a> has a brand new theme that mirrors the experience in your WordPress admin, with a more visual experience, and better search and statistics.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3594" src="https://wordpress.org/news/files/2015/04/plugin-directory-1024x768.png" alt="plugin-directory" width="692" height="519" /></p>\n<p>As well as a facelift, there are some great new features for you to play around with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Favorites – when you’re logged in to you WordPress.org account, this page gives you direct access to the plugins that you have favorited.</li>\n<li>Beta Testing – try out plugins where developers are experimenting with new features for WordPress.</li>\n<li>Search by plugin author – you can search for a plugin author using their username.</li>\n<li>Better statistics – listings now display the number of active installs so you can see how many people are actually using a plugin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2015/03/04/new-plugin-directory-theme/">overview of the new theme</a> was posted by Scott Reilly.</p>\n<h2>Better Statistics</h2>\n<p>We’ve made huge improvements to <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/stats/">our statistics</a>. This gives us more useful information about the WordPress versions people are using, their PHP version, and their MySQL version.</p>\n<p>Already these new statistics have provided us with useful insights into WordPress usage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More than 43% of all sites are running the latest version of WordPress. Previously, we thought only 10% of sites were up-to-date. By excluding sites that are no longer online we were able to improve these statistics.</li>\n<li>We were able to clear up the data around WordPress 3.0, bringing it more in line with expectations. This anomaly was a by-product of spammers.</li>\n<li>Only 15.9% of sites are using PHP 5.2, which is better than we thought.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the coming months we’ll be able to use these statistics to bring you new tools and improvements, and to make more informed decisions across the board.

Navigate to the Tools screen in your WordPress backend to get started (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31373">#31373</a>). </li>\n<li><strong>Browsing and switching installed themes</strong> has been added to the Customizer to make switching faster and more convenient.

Please let us know if you hit any snags (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5809/">#5809</a>).</li>\n<li>New <code>wp.a11y.speak()</code> functionality helps your JavaScript talk to screen readers to better inform impaired users what&#8217;s happening on-screen. Try it out in your plugin or theme and let us know if you notice any adverse affects (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31368/">#31368</a>).</li>\n<li>Named clause support has been added to <code>WP_Query</code>, <code>WP_Comment_Query</code>, and <code>WP_User_Query</code>, allowing specific <code>meta_query</code> clauses to be used with <code>orderby</code>.

This was the 3rd, of a now annual, pan-European WordCamp and every year it gets better.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a pretty exciting prospect, as we receive the announcement of next year&#8217;s WordCamp Europe 2016 which will take place in Vienna, Austria, 24-26 June 2016.</p>\n<h3>On larger WordCamps</h3>\n<p>As described on WordCamp Central:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordCamps are informal, community-organized events that are put together by WordPress users like you. Everyone from casual users to core developers participate, share ideas, and get to know each other.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Generally speaking, WordCamps are based around a local community in a specific city. WordCamp Europe is one of two annual WordCamps that span a larger region. The other is WordCamp San Francisco, which is widely considered to be &#8220;the mother ship&#8221;, and will likely evolve into WordCamp US in its next incarnation.</p>\n<p>This new approach of embracing larger WordCamps seems to me to be a sign of a maturing community and project. The content of these WordCamps also seems to reflect this maturation, as topics tend to be less technical and more high level. Covering issues like ethics and cross-community relations.</p>\n<h3>Other regions</h3>\n<p>As individual regions begin to reach similar levels of maturity, the move toward these larger WordCamps is a natural progression. Earlier this year at <a href="https://brisbane.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp Brisbane</a> in Australia, there were a number of attendees from the wider Asia Pacific region. The same will be true of <a href="https://kansai.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp Kansai</a> in July this year with attendees from outside of Japan travelling to attend and speak.</p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if, in the not-too-distant-future, we&#8217;ll also see a pan-Asia Pacific WordCamp being organised. Particularly when you look at the size of WordCamps already in places like Tokyo, with attendance approaching 1500 people.</p>\n<h3>Moving forward</h3>\n<p>The European community has set a wonderful example of how a large, roaming, pan-regional WordCamp can and does work. Embraced by the community, and growing every year, with attendance from all over the world.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m very much looking forward to WordCamp Europe 2016 in Vienna, Austria, as we all continue to grow as a community and push WordPress together. Hope to see you there!</p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/schmitzoide">Marcel Schmitz</a> for the featured image.</em></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 16:14:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Japh";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"Matt: Celebrating 10 Years";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45188";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/celebrating-10-years-of-wordpress-com-automattic-wordpress-com-news/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:117:"<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We did an <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/?p=31295">official ten year post and video</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 03:58:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"WPTavern: Get WordPress Notifications as a Daily or Weekly Digest";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45667";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://wptavern.com/get-wordpress-notifications-as-a-daily-or-weekly-digest";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3513:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/phone.jpg"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/phone.jpg?resize=1025%2C473" alt="photo credit: Jan Vašek" class="size-full wp-image-45822" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/7174B21D56">Jan Vašek</a>\n<p>One of the most persistent underlying causes of stress in the digital age is the feeling of drowning in communication. Nearly every Monday on Twitter begins with a litany of complaints from friends about the sheer volume of email that is waiting to be answered. Notifications for all the apps that were supposed to make our lives easier have piled up and the pressure to be &#8220;always on&#8221; suffocates any spark of creative thinking.</p>\n<p>If you want to keep a clean inbox, you have to be very intentional about managing and consolidating as many email notifications as possible. Fortunately for WordPress site owners there&#8217;s a new plugin that will help keep your website from becoming part of the problem.</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/swissspidy/" target="_blank">Pascal Birchler</a> and the folks at <a href="http://required.ch/" target="_blank">required+</a> have just released <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/digest/" target="_blank">Digest Notifications</a>, a plugin that aggregates your notifications into one manageable digest. Its settings panel allows you to set the frequency to either daily or monthly at a set time of day. This allows users to limit these notifications to work hours, if so desired.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/digest-settings.png"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/digest-settings.png?resize=1025%2C317" alt="digest-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45812" /></a></p>\n<p>The digest consolidates the following events into one email:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New Core Updates</li>\n<li>New comments that need to be moderated (depending on your settings under &#8216;Settings&#8217; -> &#8216;Discussion&#8217;)</li>\n<li>New user sign-ups</li>\n<li>Password resets by users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what an example digest email might look like:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/digest-email.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/digest-email.png?resize=1025%2C868" alt="digest-email" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45813" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin is also extensible and includes a number of well documented hooks that developers can use to add to the digest queue and modify the email message.</p>\n<p>Depending on how active your site is, the plugin may not make a huge dent in your email load but it can help to keep WordPress from becoming part of your email problem. If you have an active blog with a global readership, then you are likely getting dozens of comment moderation emails throughout the day and night. New user signups can also quickly flood your inbox during times of peak activity.</p>\n<p>Not all notifications are so imperative that you need to receive them by email immediately but you probably don&#8217;t want to turn them off entirely either. This plugin offers you a happy medium. If you&#8217;re struggling to stay afloat in your inbox and WordPress-generated emails are piling up, install <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/digest/" target="_blank">Digest Notifications</a> to stay in the loop while keeping emails to a minimum.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 21:54:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"WPTavern: Automattic Celebrates 10th Anniversary";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45779";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"http://wptavern.com/automattic-celebrates-10th-anniversary";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3885:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/automattic-offices.jpg"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/automattic-offices.jpg?resize=1025%2C478" alt="photo credit: Peter Slutsky" class="size-full wp-image-22370" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://peterslutsky.com/2013/05/14/pics-touring-automattics-new-office/">Peter Slutsky</a>\n<p>Automattic is <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/06/26/celebrating-10-years-of-wordpress-com-automattic/" target="_blank">celebrating its 10th year in business</a> this week. WordPress.com opened its doors in the summer of 2005 and is now closing in on a globally distributed team of 400 employees. Against all odds, CEO Matt Mullenweg, a college dropout with no initial startup funding, built a company that is now valued at $1.2 billion dollars, while successfully maintaining the free, open source WordPress project alongside it.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg took to his <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/06/ten-years-of-automattic/" target="_blank">blog</a> to reminisce about hiring employee #1 in the early days of the company.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When you think about it, Donncha was incredibly brave. WordPress had far less than 1% market share. I hadn’t joined Automattic yet — I was still working for CNET, paying Donncha with my salary, savings, and credit cards. He was leaving a Real Job for a Barely a Job; I hardly knew how to wire money to an international account to pay him.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fast forward ten years and Automattic has grown to become the most successful WordPress-based business on the books, without compromising its open source principles or users&#8217; freedoms.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It also seemed like the decks were stacked against us. We were going to try and build an open source business model different from what we had seen before, a hybrid of a downloadable open source project combined with a web service that ran the exact same software. Up to that point companies built on open source projects had usually suffocated the communities that spawned them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The open source community continues to thrive, thanks in part to the many contributions from Automattic.</p>\n<p>With <a href="http://wptavern.com/a-look-back-at-16-automattic-acquisitions-since-2007" target="_blank">17 acquisitions</a> under its belt, including the recent WooCommerce deal, Automattic has judiciously added to its numbers and expanded its horizons to include a number of non-WordPress technologies. Mullenweg strives to <a href="http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-on-ensuring-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">maintain a spirit of experimentation</a> at the company, rather than simply focusing on their successful products.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com was recently recognized in the Electronic Frontier Foundation&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2015" target="_blank">Who Has Your Back</a></em> report, for achieving a <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/06/17/a-perfect-eff-score-were-proud-to-have-your-back/" target="_blank">perfect score</a> in protecting users&#8217; rights against government requests.

Over that time period, he&#8217;s established trust with a number of people in and outside of the WordPress ecosystem. The role allows Bachiyski to focus on communication and triage security reports.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg admitted on stage that there have been communication issues in the past. He didn&#8217;t specify any examples, but one that comes to mind is <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-2-1/">WordPress 4.2.1</a>.</p>\n<p>In April 2015, security researcher <a href="http://klikki.fi/">Jouko Pynnönen</a>, published details of a security vulnerability in WordPress hours before the team released a patch. He tried contacting the WordPress security team using a variety of channels, all of which came up empty.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WordPress has refused all communication attempts about our ongoing security vulnerability cases since November 2014. We have tried to reach them by email, via the national authority (CERT-FI), and via <a href="http://hackerone.com" target="_blank">HackerOne</a>. No answer of any kind has been received since November 20, 2014.</p>\n<p>According to our knowledge, their security response team have also refused to respond to the Finnish communications regulatory authority who has tried to coordinate resolving the issues we have reported, and to staff of HackerOne, which has tried to clarify the status our open bug tickets.</p></blockquote>\n<p>No one from the WordPress security team officially announced why or how the breakdown in communication occurred. Hopefully, with Bachiyski as Security Czar for the WordPress project, breakdowns in communication like these decrease or disappear entirely.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 18:04:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: Help Improve bbPress by Taking the 2015 User Survey";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45697";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"http://wptavern.com/help-improve-bbpress-by-taking-the-2015-user-survey";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1771:"<p>If you use bbPress, it&#8217;s time to voice your opinions and let the development team know what you think by taking the <a href="https://bbpress.org/blog/2015/05/2015-bbpress-survey/">2015 bbPress user survey</a>.

A successful campaign funded by passionate supporters can make an idea into reality or bring fresh momentum for another round of development.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bi0xid/kayosey-the-first-100-accessible-theme-for-wordpre" target="_blank">Kayosey</a> is the latest community project seeking funding for a good cause &#8211; the creation of the first 100% accessible theme for WordPress. The four-person team behind the Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bi0xid/kayosey-the-first-100-accessible-theme-for-wordpre" target="_blank">campaign</a> is led by WordPress developer <a href="http://raven.es/" target="_blank">Rafa Poveda</a>, an organizer for WordCamp Sevilla and WordCamp Europe 2015. They aim to raise $6,770 to fund the development of the first AAA, fully-accessible and fully-responsive theme/framework for WordPress.</p>\n<p>If successfully funded, Kayosey will be released as a free theme, 100% GPL v2 or later, and will be submitted to the official WordPress Theme Directory for anyone to use. The theme&#8217;s creators believe that it has the potential to make a major impact on the overall accessibility of the web. Poveda summarized the goal for the campaign:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our goal is to create the first fully accessible, upgradeable and adaptable to all devices theme for WordPress. Today, <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">24% of the web works with WordPress</a>, being the most used CMS by developers. <strong>An accessible parent theme for WordPress will virtually make 1/4 of the web accessible.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Although the existence of the an accessible parent theme is not likely to translate directly into 1/4 of the web becoming more accessible, it would provide a solid starting place for developers who are interested in producing accessible themes. The vast majority of WordPress themes <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-suck-at-accessibility-its-time-to-fix-it" target="_blank">lag in meeting accessibility guidelines</a> and the official directory doesn&#8217;t have much of a selection listed under the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/" target="_blank">accessibility-ready</a> tag.</p>\n<p>Poveda and his team plan to work closely with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/" target="_blank">WordPress&#8217; Accessibility Team</a> and will propose changes to core as necessary to help make WordPress 100% accessible. They will be using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">WAI</a> (The Web Access Initiative) as a reference manual. The project will be documented publicly on GitLab and GitHub to keep supporters up to date.</p>\n<p>The Kayosey team outlined a few stretch goals beyond the € 6,000 they are hoping to raise, which would enable the team to expand the parent theme into a framework and eventually add WooCommerce compatibility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>€ 6,000 &#8211; GOAL! We will make a 100%-a11y WordPress parent theme!</li>\n<li>€ 12,000 &#8211; More than a theme &#8211; We will create Kayosey Framework, the first accessible framework, full of options to make the development easier.</li>\n<li>€ 20,000 &#8211; WooCommerce compatibility! Everyone should be able to make a shop with WordPress without external help.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So far, the Kayosey project has reached 12% of the $6,770 goal. The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bi0xid/kayosey-the-first-100-accessible-theme-for-wordpre/description" target="_blank">campaign</a> has one month remaining before the fundraising deadline.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 20:27:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Post Status: Growth in the French community";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=13527";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"https://poststatus.com/growth-in-the-french-community/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9310:"<p>After the first WordCamp in France in 2008, organizer <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/xibe">Xavier Borderie</a>, co-founder of the WordPress Francophone Association and one of the principal contributors to the French translation of WordPress, <a href="http://www.wordpress-fr.net/2008/05/04/wordcamp-paris-merci-a-tous/">wrote</a>, &#8220;We&#8217;re calling it &#8216;WordCamp Paris&#8217; and not &#8216;WordCamp France&#8217; because we&#8217;re not so blind as to think that Paris is the only city that counts. I can&#8217;t wait to see people launch WordCamps in their own cities!&#8221;</p>\n<p>It would take six years for that to happen, but in the last eight months, three new WordPress events have popped up in different cities in France, including one official WordCamp and two independent conferences.</p>\n<p>The first one on the scene was <a href="http://2014.wptech.fr">WP Tech Nantes</a>, a one-day, one-track event held in late November 2014, focused on development. They had 140 attendees for their first year and aim to double attendance in 2015. Although WP Tech draws from the growing WordPress community in Nantes, there are whispers of it going on the road.</p>\n<p>Next up was <a href="https://lyon.wordcamp.org">WordCamp Lyon</a>, now the second official WordCamp in France, which took place June 5th. True to Lyonnais culture, the event was organized on a massive barge, with 230 participants in all. A one-day event with two tracks, it was amazing to see both a high percentage of women among attendees (30% according to organizers) and a real diversity of backgrounds. There were developers, designers, bloggers, marketing folk, and even a local Drupal community leader came out to join us and compare notes.</p>\n<p>The following day, in the sunny coastal town of Biarritz in France&#8217;s Basque region, was <a href="http://2015.wpmx.org">WPMX Day</a>. The name comes from the local Meetup group and association, <a href="http://wpmx.org">WordPress Meet and Exchange</a>, founded in 2013. The close proximity to the Lyon event was a shame, but there was still a nice turnout with 110 attendees, and top-notch speakers such as <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/corsonr/">Remi Corson</a> (WooThemes, now Automattic), and <a href="https://twitter.com/WalterStephanie">Stephanie Walter</a>, known outside the WordPress community for her work in web and mobile UI.</p>\n<p>Organizers of these new events have plans to continue the tradition, giving France a total of four annual WordPress conferences. There has also been talk of starting up more topic-focused events like WP Tech, so we may soon see a French Pressnomics among others.</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zfqVcMIxLnbM.kwj1b1s4cURI&usp=sharing"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-13528" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/map-france-752x376.jpg" alt="France WordPress Map" width="752" height="376" /></a></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been working on and off with WordPress since 2007, and full time since 2011, but it wasn&#8217;t until January of 2013 that I visited my first WordCamp. The experience literally changed my life. A hardened freelancer, it gave me a taste of what it was to get out there, to share, and exchange with people about a subject that we were all passionate about. It gave me a glimpse of what was really going on around me: not only was I far from alone, but the French community was also thriving and producing a mass of interesting, exciting work.</p>\n<h3>Spotlight on France</h3>\n<p><a href="http://www.mailpoet.com">MailPoet</a> is a distributed company based in France, with a total of <a href="http://www.mailpoet.com/about-the-wysija-team-members/">13 people in 8 countries</a>. When I met co-founder <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/kgjerstad/">Kim Gjerstad</a>, a French Canadian who lives in Aix-en-Provence, at my first WordCamp in Paris, I began to get an idea of what the WordPress economy was like beyond the world of building themes. Kim spoke at WordCamp Europe in Leiden later that year about the <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/02/25/kim-gjerstad-is-the-freemium-model-right-for-your-plugin/">freemium business model</a>. Today MailPoet boasts over 3,686,635 downloads and continues to <a href="http://www.mailpoet.com/jobs/">hire new staff</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wp-rocket.me">WP Rocket</a> impressed me when, in February of this year, and following the lead of companies such as Buffer, Baremetrics, and Mattermark, they declared their <a href="http://blog.wp-rocket.me/transparency-matters/">pledge to total transparency</a> by publishing numbers on their revenue and client base. With an update and <a href="http://blog.wp-rocket.me/inside-wp-rocket-april-2015/">new data published in May</a>, this looks like it will be a quarterly tradition, one that I hope will inspire others as the taboo to share such information is very strong in France. Lead developer <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/juliobox">Julio Potier</a> runs his own WordPress security consultancy, is a regular speaker at WordCamps and other web conferences in France and abroad, and is also a core contributor. <a href="https://twitter.com/jb_ma">Jean-Baptiste Marchand-Arvier</a> &amp; <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/geekpress/">Jonathan Buttigieg</a> are also prominent community members and half of the force behind WordCamp Lyon.</p>\n<p>Another one of our local heroes is <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/imath">Mathieu Viet</a>, also known as imath. By day, Mathieu works as a programmer for La Poste. By night, he is one of the BuddyPress core developers. He is also co-organizer of the Paris Meetup group, and co-founder of <a href="http://veryfrenchtrip.com">Very French Trip</a>, which started as a small group who travelled to Leiden together for the first WordCamp Europe, and has since turned into a successful podcast. The other leaders of this group are <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/aglekis/">Grégoire Noyelle</a>, our resident Genesis specialist, and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/thierrypigot">Thierry Pigot</a>, who recently signed on as CEO of <a href="http://www.whodunit.fr">Whodunit</a>, one of the largest WordPress agencies in Paris (they are both also on the organizing team for WordCamp Paris).</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ozh">Ozh Richard</a>, who is probably best known as co-author of <em>Professional WordPress Plugin Development</em> and creator of YOURLS, hails from Nantes. He attended WP Tech Nantes where he signed quite a few autographs, and gave his first ever talk at WordCamp Paris in January. It was quite the honor!</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/">Polylang</a> is quickly becoming the preferred solution among many for creating multilingual sites with WordPress, the other two major contenders being WPML and Multilingual Press. We knew its creator was French, but it took the community a while to put a real name on the elusive <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/chouby/">Chouby</a>. Frédéric Demarle made his public debut at WordCamp Lyon and was immediately embraced and revered by all.</p>\n<p>France also proudly counts a number of core contributors among its ranks, including: Amaury Balmer, Xavier Borderie, Alex Concha, Frederic Demarle, Nicolas Juen, Kevin Legrand, Michel (xiligroup), Lionel Pointet, Julio Potier, Fabien Quatravaux, Ozh Richard, &amp; Grégory Viguier to name a few I was able to identify.</p>\n<h3>Acting locally, thinking globally</h3>\n<p>WordPress, this simple piece of software that so many of us have built our businesses on — built a big part of our lives around — is a global community. It brings people together from all parts of the globe to share knowledge, promote a common philosophy, and develop a self-sustaining economy.</p>\n<p>In the same way we talk about promoting WordPress from the ground floor up, so too do local communities play an essential role in this greater ecosystem. WordCamps are both proof and reminders of that, and the growth seen in local communities in France has been tremendous this past year. Success stories from the other side of the world can be inspiring, but success stories from your own backyard are tangible.</p>\n<p>Only in local communities can we tackle problems that are specific to our cultures, to our laws and to our specific needs. Working together at this ground level creates momentum, and I believe that’s what we’re seeing here in France. WordPress is viable; an open-source economy is viable. The open exchange of ideas, the very principal of community that WordPress is built on, creates an environment in which we all can thrive, both financially and as human beings.</p>\n<p>The only foreseeable danger I see in local communities is losing sight of the global picture — of where we came from. All roads must lead back to WordPress. It’s not a perfect road; there are bumps to navigate and bridges to be built. I believe that strong, united local communities can make a global impact, helping to pave those roads and create a better experience for all. I also believe that the global recognition of these local communities can go a long way toward encouraging continued growth.

The theme is centered around showcasing the work of visual artists such as designers, photographers, craft makers, painters, etc., with portfolio items featured prominently on the homepage template.</p>\n<p>Argent was designed by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/melchoyce" target="_blank">Mel Choyce</a>, co-author of the popular <a href="http://wptavern.com/flounder-a-free-wordpress-theme-with-colorful-post-formats" target="_blank">Flounder</a> and <a href="http://wptavern.com/aventurine-a-free-wordpress-theme-featuring-bold-typography-and-bright-colors" target="_blank">Aventurine</a> themes. Her designs are generally very focused and Argent is no exception. While the theme is well-suited to a wide range of creative professionals, it wasn&#8217;t designed to be an agency/business/blogging theme all in one. Argent is clearly a portfolio theme right out of the gate.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/argent-screenshot.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/argent-screenshot.jpg?resize=621%2C761" alt="argent-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45568" /></a></p>\n<p>Artists won&#8217;t need to fight with this theme to simplify it down to something that&#8217;s easy to personalize. The theme&#8217;s customizer options allow you to display 3, 6, or 9 portfolio projects on the homepage template. It also includes controls for changing the header and background images and text colors.</p>\n<p>All of the content on posts and pages is centered. There is no sidebar, but Argent includes support for three footer widget areas.</p>\n<p>When used on a self-hosted WordPress site in combination with Jetpack and its Custom Content Types module, you can add portfolio projects. Each portfolio item includes support for a full-width image carousel. This is automatically generated from the first gallery included in the portfolio post.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/argent-portfolio-gallery.png"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/argent-portfolio-gallery.png?resize=621%2C698" alt="argent-portfolio-gallery" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45577" /></a></p>\n<p>One thing to appreciate about the blog section is that you don&#8217;t have to worry about having excessively large, oddly-shaped featured images to make it look like the demo. Argent&#8217;s blog archives template is simple with short, one-sentence excerpts and small rectangular featured images.</p>\n<p>Typography is never an afterthought in Choyce&#8217;s designs, and Argent places a strong emphasis on <a href="https://argentdemo.wordpress.com/readability/" target="_blank">readability</a>. The theme features the contrasting &#8220;Alegreya&#8221; font for headers and quotes and &#8220;Cabin&#8221; for paragraph text.

Opponents of the feature voiced concerns about the readiness of the UI for all screen sizes, particularly for the desktop where many find the experience of managing menus to be crammed into an unnecessarily narrow space.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the feature plugin&#8217;s author <a href="http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-tentatively-approved-for-wordpress-4-3" target="_blank">attributed</a> the broader community&#8217;s ongoing Customizer resistance to &#8220;more of an educational issue,&#8221; WordPress core contributors published <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/" target="_blank">a post reaffirming their commitment to advancing the customizer</a>. It states that the purpose behind the live preview framework is to build user trust by providing a safe way to make non-destructive changes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are committed to providing live preview for all aspects of site customization and making it usable on all devices from phones to large screens,&#8221; Boren said in the post.</p>\n<p>The admin menus screen will continue to be supported for the time being, but the long-term plan is to eliminate them in future versions of WordPress in favor of the customizer interface.</p>\n<h3>A Plugin to Unhook the Customizer</h3>\n<p>The new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-remove-all-parts/" target="_blank">Customizer Remove All Parts</a> plugin, hosted on GitHub under the acronym &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/parallelus/wp-crap" target="_blank">WP-CRAP</a>,&#8221; was written in response to the decision to bring menus in the customizer. WordPress developers Jesse Petersen and Andy Wilkerson <a href="http://www.petersenmediagroup.com/wordpress-tips/a-response-to-the-wordpress-customizer-expansion-removal/" target="_blank">joined forces to create a plugin</a> that would unhook the Customizer from every aspect of WordPress site management.</p>\n<p>Once installed, it removes all customizer links from the Appearance menu, Themes screen, and the admin toolbar, essentially rolling your site back to the days prior to WordPress 3.4 when the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API" target="_blank">Theme Customization API</a> was introduced. I tested it and found that it works exactly as advertised.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/customizer-links.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/customizer-links.jpg?resize=772%2C250" alt="customizer-links" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45553" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Anything that was having its link hijacked to go to the Customizer has had that filter removed,&#8221; Petersen said. &#8220;This is the nuclear option, as there are no settings whatsoever. Use it if you don’t want your clients or team to have any access to or knowledge of the Customizer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Petersen and Wilkerson <a href="http://www.petersenmediagroup.com/wordpress-tips/a-response-to-the-wordpress-customizer-expansion-removal/" target="_blank">contend that menus are handled as content</a> in the WordPress database and therefore do not require the same treatment as other design aspects of the site.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Menus aren’t design,&#8221; Petersen said. &#8220;They are content. Look in the database, menus are found in the posts tables. As such, they aren’t subject to the same design edits as other items in Customizer, such as the background or custom header image/logo. For those items, I 100% support a Customizer or similar interface to preview changes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This argument may not bear as much weight when WordPress finally gets frontend content editing capabilities in core &#8211; a feature which <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/" target="_blank">Boren&#8217;s post</a> identified as possibly integrating with the customizer.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Petersen and Wilkerson want the option to turn the customizer off in the dashboard, but WordPress&#8217; &#8220;Decisions, not Options&#8221; <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/" target="_blank">philosophy</a> prevents that from being a viable possibility.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are currently in development of a fork that allows you to selectively remove everything based on user role and more detailed settings,&#8221; Petersen said. &#8220;This is how we feel Customizer should work in core. There should be some way to turn it off in the dashboard, no different than your ability to turn off the admin toolbar. Maybe this will get rolled into core in 4.5.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress, in its vanilla state, is not perfect for all scenarios, but this is why the plugin system exists. It allows anyone to make WordPress their own, offering alternatives for those who disagree with the direction of core development. The WP-CRAP plugin is a perfect example of utilizing the plugin system to have WordPress your way.</p>\n<p>Based on the &#8220;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/09/trust-live-preview-and-menus-in-the-customizer/" target="_blank">Trust, Live Preview, and Menus in the Customizer</a>&#8221; core manifesto, WordPress users can expect that future releases will further the customizer agenda into every aspect of site customization. If you feel that the customizer has over extended its reach and planted its hooks into too many areas of WordPress, the WP-CRAP plugin offers you the option to turn it all off.  Download it from <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-remove-all-parts/" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a> or via its home on <a href="https://github.com/parallelus/wp-crap" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 00:01:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"Matt: Good Environment Reads";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45181";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/earth-reads/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:889:"<p>In light of the Pope&#8217;s encyclical last week and the US election season ramping up, there has been some great writing on the environment lately.

It features articles on WordPress, tutorials, and philosophical discussions surrounding the software. A portion of the site lists stores recommended by Yablon for people to purchase WordPress products. He also sells WordPress educational services for a flat fee.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordPressHelperAboutPage.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-45523" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordPressHelperAboutPage.png?resize=500%2C283" alt="WordPress Helpers About Page" /></a>WordPress Helpers About Page\n<p>Shortly after launching the site in January 2015, Yablon was contacted by the WordPress Foundation&#8217;s lawyers concerning his domain name. <a href="http://thewordpresshelpers.com/wordpress-trademark-lawsuit">According to Yablon</a>, he negotiated with the Foundation to try to use the domain name. Negotiations failed and on June 18th, 2015, the Foundation filed the lawsuit.</p>\n<h2>Lawyers Battle it Out</h2>\n<p>The <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/">United States Trademark and Patent Office</a> is a public website where visitors can discover and file for patents and trademarks. On <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=86448439&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=documentSearch">November 7th, 2014</a>, the WordPress Foundation <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn86448439&docId=APP20141111074846#docIndex=7&page=1">submitted an application</a> to register the WordPress character mark which consists of standard characters, without claim to any particular font, style, size, or color.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordPressMark.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-45533" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordPressMark.png?resize=660%2C127" alt="WordPress Standard Character Mark" /></a>WordPress Standard Character Mark\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of where the mark is already in use.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordPressMarkinAction.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-45534" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WordPressMarkinAction.png?resize=649%2C239" alt="WordPress Mark in Use" /></a>WordPress Mark in Use\n<p>Once applications are published to the <a href="https://tmog.uspto.gov/#issueDate=2015-04-14&serialNumber=86448439"><span class="normal">Trademark Official Gazette</span></a>, parties who <span class="normal">believe it will be damaged by the registration of the mark may file a notice of opposition with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. If no party files an opposition or extension request within 30 days after the publication date, then a certificate of registration will be issued eleven weeks after the publication date.</span></p>\n<p>On May 5th, 2015, Yablon filed an <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&pty=OPP&eno=1">opposition request </a>stating that if the Foundation successfully registers the mark, his company and others would be gravely and adversely effected. The Foundation&#8217;s lawyers responded on June 19th, 2015, by asking the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&pty=OPP&eno=4">suspend the registration process</a> until the civil lawsuit in the District Court has completed.</p>\n<p>On June 21st, 2015, Yablon <a href="http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91221895&pty=OPP&eno=7">filed a motion</a> requesting default judgement and objected to the Foundation&#8217;s request to suspend the preceding. The case has yet to play out in court but lawyers from both parties are  battling it out in the public sphere.</p>\n<h2>A Conversation with Yablon</h2>\n<p>I spoke with Yablon on the phone for over an hour to figure out why he&#8217;s put himself in this position. During our conversation, I determined that he&#8217;s intelligent and has a good understanding of trademark law. He believes the WordPress Helpers website furthers the WordPress project by being an informational resource.</p>\n<p>Using WordPress in his domain name is a business decision that allows people to instantly know what his site is about. He genuinely cares about the WordPress project, its community, and respects the Foundation&#8217;s rights to protect its trademarks.</p>\n<p>He also told me that he&#8217;s not out to make a buck or prove a point. He&#8217;s defending his business from an entity that has a domain policy, not a law. He stressed that he&#8217;s not a villain as many in the WordPress community have made him out to be.</p>\n<p>Near the end of our conversation, he said he just wants to run his business with his current domain name and is willing to make any changes to his non-affiliation disclaimer the Foundation deems necessary.</p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s at Stake</h2>\n<p>If Yablon gets the United States Patent and Trademark Office to deny the Foundation&#8217;s trademark and can win his lawsuit, it would make it easier for others to use WordPress in top-level domain names. It would be a crushing blow to the Foundation and limit its ability to protect WordPress&#8217; branding.</p>\n<p>Public opinion on Twitter, the Advanced WordPress Facebook group, and other social outlets suggest an overwhelming majority of people are in support of the Foundation. It will be interesting to see how the case concludes and what legal precedent it may set for others.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 22:16:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Matt: Ten Years of Automattic";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45174";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/ten-years-of-automattic/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6141:"<p>Ten years ago the first official Automattician was <a href="http://z9.io/">Donncha O Caoimh</a>, and he had no idea what he was in for. Neither did I, honestly. And it’s been amazing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ll remember the days before I knew everything.<br />\n&#8212; The Automattic Creed</p></blockquote>\n<p>When you think about it, Donncha was incredibly brave. <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> had far less than 1% market share. I hadn’t joined <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> yet &#8212; I was still working for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNET">CNET</a>, paying Donncha with my salary, savings, and credit cards. He was leaving a Real Job for a Barely a Job; I hardly knew how to wire money to an international account to pay him. I’d just made <a href="http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/">a giant screw-up</a> (probably my biggest ever), taking money to have spam advertising on WordPress.org, so I wasn’t the most confidence-inspiring leader.</p>\n<p>It also seemed like the decks were stacked against us. We were going to try and build an open source business model different from what we had seen before, a hybrid of a downloadable open source project combined with a web service that ran the exact same software. Up to that point companies built on open source projects had usually suffocated the communities that spawned them.</p>\n<p>Sign me up, right? But we had one important thing going for us: at our cores, we shared a deep belief that open source could transform any industry it touched and that web publishing needed to be democratized. We’d been hackers-in-arms together coding on WordPress, and knew we could take that and build on it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation.<br />\n&#8211; The Automattic Creed</p></blockquote>\n<p>Within that first year we were joined by <a href="https://andy.wordpress.com/">Andy</a>, <a href="http://ryan.boren.me/">Ryan</a>, <a href="http://toni.org/">Toni</a>, and <a href="http://romanticrobot.net/">Mark</a>, and together we began building a business which looks remarkably similar to what Automattic does today. (We&#8217;re all still at Automattic, by the way.)</p>\n<p>We just want to make the web a better place. We&#8217;re proud to contribute to what I consider the best open source project in the world, <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. We bring it to as wide an audience as possible through hosting it on <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>, and providing services for the ones we don&#8217;t host with tools like <a href="http://jetpack.me/">Jetpack</a>. Through it all, we have fun and experiment with side projects that have become crucial to the ways we work &#8212; <a href="http://p2theme.com/">P2</a>, <a href="http://cloudup.com/">Cloudup</a>, <a href="http://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a>, and dozens more that we tried, failed, learned something from, and tried again.</p>\n<p>Our work is far from finished, and I hope there are hundreds of failures we learn from over the next 20 years. One of the things that makes me happiest is that I get to wake up every morning and work on the hard problem of making the web a better and more open place, and I do it alongside close to <a href="http://automattic.com/about/">400 talented people at Automattic</a> and thousands in the broader community. For me this is a life&#8217;s work. The first decade is merely the first chapter of what I hope to be a very long book, which will eventually tell the story of a movement and a company that are at the core of this crazy thing we call &#8220;the web.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day.<br />\n&#8212; The Automattic Creed</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some find it strange that someone in this day and age would have the same job for a decade. The truth is, it&#8217;s not the same job: it’s always evolving. At times it&#8217;s been comfortable, at times it&#8217;s been extraordinarily challenging. I&#8217;ve needed to change how I work. Automattic has changed. The structure of the company is designed to accommodate growth, and we’re constantly experimenting with how we work and relate to one another.</p>\n<p>Half the time I feel like we&#8217;re making it up as we go along &#8212; I&#8217;ve never managed a distributed company of 400 people before. But the important things stay the same: the desire for impact and my love for the people I work with. They embody the Automattic creed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I will never stop learning. I won’t just work on things that are assigned to me. I know there’s no such thing as a status quo. I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers. I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I’ll remember the days before I knew everything. I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company. I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day. Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thank you, Donncha, for believing in me all those years ago and pioneering the way for a company that would come to impact a lot of the world. Thank you Andy, Ryan, Toni, and Mark. Thank you to every Automattician that’s made the same leap. We’re building something that gives people all over the world a voice and that people can trust to be thriving a century from now, and that’s huge.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot more to do, and I can’t wait to see what a “20 Years of Automattic” post says. I’m a lucky guy.</p>\n<p>Update: <a href="http://z9.io/2015/06/20/ten-years-at-automattic/">Donncha has a post talking about starting at Automattic</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 02:26:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"WPTavern: Conditionally Hide BuddyPress Profile Field Groups Based on User Role";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=44630";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://wptavern.com/conditionally-hide-buddypress-profile-field-groups-based-on-user-role";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3930:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/buddypress-conditional-field-groups-featured.jpg"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/buddypress-conditional-field-groups-featured.jpg?resize=672%2C309" alt="buddypress-conditional-field-groups-featured" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45508" /></a></p>\n<p>For many BuddyPress-powered social networks, <a href="https://codex.buddypress.org/administrator-guide/extended-profiles/" target="_blank">profile field groups</a> do not work as a one-size-fits-all container. This is especially true for sites with a more complex and varied user base.</p>\n<p>By default, BuddyPress displays all profile field groups to all users, whether they are applicable or not. The new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-conditional-field-groups/" target="_blank">BuddyPress Conditional Field Groups</a> plugin is one way to address this problem and provide more flexibility for administrators in field group creation.</p>\n<p>The plugin, created by WordPress developer <a href="http://tannermoushey.com/" target="_blank">Tanner Moushey</a>, allows administrators to hide a field group based on <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities" target="_blank">user roles</a>. This makes it possible to collect and display different sets of information based on selections assigned in the plugin&#8217;s settings panel.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/buddypress-conditional-field-groups-settings.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/buddypress-conditional-field-groups-settings.png?resize=982%2C550" alt="buddypress-conditional-field-groups-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45497" /></a></p>\n<p>As all field groups default to visible to all users, the field groups that are checked in the settings will not be shown for the corresponding user role on the front end. For example, for users with author or contributor roles, the site can feature additional profile fields related to their specific roles in the community while hiding that field group for all other roles. Here&#8217;s a quick demo:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bp-conditional-profile-field-groups-demo.gif"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bp-conditional-profile-field-groups-demo.gif?resize=480%2C360" alt="bp-conditional-profile-field-groups-demo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45504" /></a></p>\n<p>Combine it with the <a href="http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-adds-conditional-profile-fields-to-buddypress" target="_blank">Conditional Profile Fields</a> plugin and you have a great deal of flexibility.</p>\n<p>Of course, this plugin only applies on sites where members have been neatly divided into user roles by an administrator. Since these roles are generally assigned based on publishing capabilities, this plugin is likely useful for sites that are running an active blog.</p>\n<p>If Moushey were to further extend BuddyPress Conditional Field Groups plugin, it would be useful to be able to hide field groups based on member type, as defined by any plugin utilizing the new <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-2-on-track-to-provide-a-basic-member-type-api" target="_blank">Member Type API</a> added in <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-2-spumoni-released-featuring-new-member-type-api" target="_blank">BuddyPress 2.2</a>. This would greatly expand the usefulness of the plugin for more communities.</p>\n<p>The plugin in its current form is a valuable tool for BuddyPress-powered communities that rely heavily on WordPress user roles to define capabilities for a diverse user base. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-conditional-field-groups/" target="_blank">BuddyPress Conditional Field Groups</a> is available for free on WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 02:24:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"WPTavern: Theme Juice: A New Auto Site Generator for WordPress Development with Vagrant";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45438";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"http://wptavern.com/theme-juice-a-new-vagrant-configuration-for-wordpress-development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7671:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/juice.jpg"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/juice.jpg?resize=1025%2C508" alt="photo credit: Roma" class="size-full wp-image-45470" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://stocksnap.io/photo/6OJ88579KG">Roma</a>\n<p>As WordPress developers everywhere are adopting Vagrant for local development, new configurations seem to pop up every week to address the needs of different teams and workflows. <a href="http://themejuice.it/" target="_blank">Theme Juice</a> is the newest open source project to join the ever-growing list of <a href="http://wptavern.com/13-vagrant-resources-for-wordpress-development" target="_blank">WordPress-related Vagrant resources</a>.</p>\n<p>The project is based on <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" target="_blank">VVV</a>, one of the most popular and best-supported Vagrant configurations. Its VM is built on an Apache fork of VVV called <a href="https://github.com/ericmann/vvv-apache" target="_blank">VVV-Apache</a>.</p>\n<p>Theme Juice installs as a Ruby gem and requires requires <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a> and <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>. The <code>tj create</code> command leads you through prompts to set up project information, location, database info and will then create a local development environment (if one isn&#8217;t already in place.) It automatically syncs the local project location with the project location within the VM, enabling it to be run from anywhere on your system.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ezgif.com-optimize-2.gif"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ezgif.com-optimize-2.gif?resize=640%2C379" alt="ezgif.com-optimize (2)" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45464" /></a></p>\n<p>It also <a href="https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-cli#is-windows-supported" target="_blank">supports Windows</a> with a few feature limitations.</p>\n<p>If you are not using Apache, Theme Juice can be modified for use with Nginx via the original VVV, which is as easy as running it with a few flags:</p>\n<p><code>tj new --vm-box git@github.com:Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV.git --nginx</code></p>\n<h4>Access Projects from Other Devices, Including Mobile</h4>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/xip-.io_.jpg"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/xip-.io_.jpg?resize=640%2C230" alt="xip-.io" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45462" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the unique features of Theme Juice is that every project created with <code>tj</code> is automatically set to support <a href="http://xip.io/" target="_blank">xip.io</a>, a free magic domain name that provides wildcard DNS for any IP address. This enables access to virtual hosts on your development server from other devices on your local network, ie. tablets and phones. This works best with OSX, according to TJ&#8217;s documentation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re using OSX, then everything should work out of the box. If you&#8217;re not using OSX, then you&#8217;ll need to point port 80 on your host machine to 8080; Vagrant cannot do this by default for security reasons.</p>\n<p>Once everything is good to go, you can access a project from another device on the same network by going to:<br />\n< project-name >.< your-hosts-ip-address >.xip.io </p>\n<p>e.g. themejuice.192.168.1.1.xip.io.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This feature allows you to easily test your development projects on mobile devices with no extra configuration required.</p>\n<h3>The Origins of Theme Juice</h3>\n<p>The project was created by <a href="http://ezekielg.com/" target="_blank">Ezekiel Gabrielse</a> and the folks at <a href="http://produceresults.com/" target="_blank">Produce Results</a> for internal use at their agency. Gabrielse is the lead developer for a small team of developers for whom Theme Juice is now an indispensable tool.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We work at a fast pace, so having the ability to create and remove development projects easily, a well as quickly restore/set up existing projects, is essential to keeping our flow, well, flowing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been dogfooding and developing this utility for almost 10 months and are excited to finally get it out to the community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gabrielse built Theme Juice to ease the process of creating new development sites, which he found to be somewhat inconvenient with VVV.</p>\n<p>&#8220;After a few weeks of using vanilla VVV, I quickly realized that the process of creating a new site was very repetitive, and like any developer, I sought to automate that repetition,&#8221; he said. (This was long before <a href="http://wptavern.com/variable-vvv-a-new-vvv-site-creation-wizard-for-wordpress" target="_blank">Variable VVV</a> was released, which automates site creation and deletion.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;What started as a quick little (actually, it got pretty large) Rake task included in our company starter theme, quickly grew into a separate project that I extracted out to a Ruby gem.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The resulting Theme Juice project integrates with VVV and leverages many of its unique features but adds auto site setup and additional functionality to manage build tools for Gabrielse&#8217;s development team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Suffice it to say, it saves us time by automating the entire process of creating new development projects,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We also incorporated a sort of crude scripting via a configuration file (called a Juicefile) that allows us to easily run any build processes we need to upon project creation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once Gabrielse realized how useful that functionality was, he pushed it out further and abstracted all of the team&#8217;s build tools to the configuration. This enabled them to seamlessly switch between tools whenever a project required it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve recently changed from Guard to Grunt, from NPM packages to Bower packages,&#8221; Gabrielse said. &#8220;Having all of those tools abstracted out to <code>tj</code> commands, we didn&#8217;t have to change anything in our workflow, our build scripts, our deployments, etc., because everything was already using the command aliases provided by <code>tj</code>. This also allows us to transition from project to project without having to worry about how to run the build tools for that particular project, as it&#8217;s all abstracted out, so that we can focus on the task at hand.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Theme Juice caters towards experienced developers who like to use modern build tools and systems for their development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Using our starter theme, we use Composer for PHP/WP plugin management, Bower for front-end dependencies, Grunt for managing build tools, which includes Coffee, Haml, and Sass compilation,&#8221; Gabrielse said. &#8220;At first glance this seems daunting to have to manage all of that, but with using <code>tj</code>, it&#8217;s easy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A list of all the global options and commands is available on the <a href="http://themejuice.it/" target="_blank">Theme Juice documentation page</a>.</p>\n<p>In the future, Gabrielse plans to extend Theme Juice to handle deployments. Right now he is leaning towards integrating an automated Capistrano workflow but is open to other suggestions now that the project is public.

WordPress powers over 35% of the web now. The REST API has been in WordPress core for a few years; the year after the REST API was merged into core, WordPress gained nearly 5% marketshare.</p>\n<p>Almost all WordPress sites use the REST API in some form or another, and an estimated 15% of all native apps use WordPress purely as a backend. 80% of the top 100 news websites run WordPress with front-ends powered by the REST API. A dozen popular hosted website platforms have custom admins or front-end editors that use the API.</p>\n<p>All of the &#8220;we should get to this eventually&#8221; items have actually been done, unbelievably, and we&#8217;ve entered the Golden Age of the WordPress REST API.</p>\n<p>Many people all across the web are using the API. Here are some of their stories.</p>\n<h3>Jack, A YouTube User</h3>\n<p>Meet Jack. He&#8217;s an avid follower of various different YouTube channels, some of which are 15 years old now. YouTube is still one of the biggest media companies, especially since the number of hamsterkitten videos has skyrocketed since the animal was first crossbred in 2018. Jack runs a fan site that has a few thousand hits a day, which is not a huge site, but roughly in the middle of the long-tail of WordPress sites. He hopes to grow it further though.</p>\n<p>Jack&#8217;s just seen a great new video pop up on the new video feed. After having watched it (and taken extensive notes), he decides to share it with his followers on his WordPress site. Underneath the video, he taps on the &#8220;Share on WordPress&#8221; link.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-13470" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/api-sharetowp-752x233.png" alt="api-sharetowp" width="752" height="233" /> Due to the decentralized nature of WordPress sites, YouTube can&#8217;t register with Jack&#8217;s site directly without a lot of effort. Instead, YouTube has registered with WordPress.org as a client beforehand (just like a normal centralized service). WordPress.org acts as a middleman between centralized services and clients, and the millions of WordPress installs out there on the &#8216;net.</p>\n<p>YouTube sends Jack off to WordPress.org to create a post. WordPress.org checks and finds that YouTube is a registered client, and they haven&#8217;t been blacklisted or had their tokens revoked.  Usually, WordPress.org would ask Jack to enter his site, but Jack&#8217;s done this before, so his browser has remembered the sites he&#8217;s entered previously. He picks his site from the list (hamsterkitten.com).</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-13471" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/api-connectto-752x351.png" alt="api-connectto" width="752" height="351" /></p>\n<p>In the background, WordPress.org asks hamsterkitten.com to issue credentials for YouTube, and tells them how to talk to each other directly. (These are OAuth 1.0a credentials, sent over insecure HTTP, since Jack hasn&#8217;t gotten around to setting up his free SSL certificate yet. One of these days&#8230;)</p>\n<p>hamsterkitten.com checks and finds that Jack has already done this before, so YouTube already has a set of credentials ready to go. He&#8217;s also already approved linking his YouTube account to his user account on his site, so he doesn&#8217;t need to approve his account manually. It passes the credentials back to YouTube, and YouTube sends a request back with the video data.</p>\n<p>Jack doesn&#8217;t see any of these happening in the background. His browser sends him off to hamsterkitten.com&#8217;s WordPress admin, where the video is pre-entered into his editor. He adds some witty comments and publishes the post. YouTube then automatically shares the video on his YouTube account as well for him, and automatically sends a notification to his YouTube followers to keep them up-to-date.</p>\n<p>Jack&#8217;s post turns out to be enormously popular, and starts a new wave of hamsterkitten fandom, earning him millions from the movie tie-ins and branding promotions.</p>\n<p>Despite the decentralised nature of WordPress sites, YouTube was able to work seamlessly with Jack&#8217;s site. It used WordPress.org as a middleman to bridge the gap, without sharing any private data with WordPress.org. It did this all while keeping the connection secure over insecure HTTP.</p>\n<h3>Jill, A Mobile Developer</h3>\n<p>On the other side of the world, Jill&#8217;s a mobile developer working on her first app. She&#8217;s heard all about this hamsterkitten craze, and has seen a business opportunity in creating a mobile app to post photos of them wherever you are in the world.</p>\n<p>Jill wants to be able to post to any WordPress site, but can&#8217;t go around and register her app on every site. Instead, she goes and registers her app on WordPress.org, which gives her access to every site with an extra step or two.</p>\n<p>While waiting for her app request to be approved, she sets up a new WordPress test site, which humorously uses the domain wassupwitd.at. (She knows that domain hacks are <em>so</em> early 2000s, but she still likes them.) She registers her client manually on her test site, which issues her with a client key and secret. She starts writing her client using these directly.</p>\n<p>Her client is a pretty basic wrapper around the Camera app that lets you upload directly to your site, but with some tricks up its sleeve. She adds some special functionality for sites with WooCommerce or EDD (which combined now represent 80% of online e-commerce), letting people create new products to sell their photos on their site, all from her app. She lets people upload multiple hamsterkitten photos at once, with support for creating sliders directly in the app.</p>\n<p>After not too long, her app request gets approved, and she&#8217;s given a key and secret to use with WordPress.org. She switches her app over to using those instead. Her app first talks to WordPress.org using this key and secret (hardcoded into the app), which then issues the app credentials for each site it accesses (stored inside the app).</p>\n<p>She wipes her test site and reinstalls it, now running stock WordPress with no real data in it. She hits the &#8220;Connect&#8221; button in her app, which sends her off to WordPress.org. WordPress.org hasn&#8217;t seen Jill before, so it asks her to enter her site&#8217;s address. She enters &#8220;wassupwitd.at&#8221; (laughing again to herself), then hits the continue button.</p>\n<p>WordPress.org hasn&#8217;t seen this site before, so it runs the auto-discovery process internally to find the site. It double-checks the authentication available there, then after making sure the site has the necessary bits enabled, asks the site to create client credentials for the app. It also redirects Jill off to the site.</p>\n<p>The site double-checks the validity of the client by sending a request to WordPress.org in the background, then creates a new client key and secret for the app. It passes these back to the app, and the two begin communicating directly.</p>\n<p>Jill hasn&#8217;t linked her app to this new test site before, so she sees the classic OAuth &#8220;Authorize This App&#8221; page on her site. After logging into her test site, she links the account to her app, and all is well with the world.</p>\n<p>Satisfied that the linking process is working for her, she gets ready to launch her app. She fills out her app details on WordPress.org to appear in the app directory, complete with a funky logo.</p>\n<p>However, disaster strikes! It turns out she made the mistake of posting her client credentials on a public GitHub repository. After reassurances from her colleagues and pets that everyone has done this at least once, she goes about setting it right.</p>\n<p>Her first step is to log on to WordPress.org and revoke her client key and secret from there. Internally, this does a few things. The first and main thing is that it stops clients from linking with new sites, since WordPress.org stops asking sites to issue new credentials when requested. This immediately stops the bleeding, but it doesn&#8217;t clean up any mess that&#8217;s already there.</p>\n<p>The next thing that happens is that WordPress.org adds the client key to the list of revoked clients. This is pulled down by sites automatically as part of their autoupdate check every day, and those sites revoke any credentials for the clients already on the site. This will make Jill&#8217;s site automatically revoke the previously issued client token in the next day, ensuring that it&#8217;s safe even if it&#8217;s already linked.</p>\n<p>Luckily for Jill, her app was still in testing, so there wasn&#8217;t a huge impact. If there was though, the WordPress security team could have assessed the issue to see how urgent it was. In urgent cases, they could check which sites have linked with the client previously and ping them via a backchannel to have them check the revocation list immediately instead. This would ensure maximum security for sites which are known to be affected.</p>\n<p>Now that she&#8217;s revoked her credentials and reissued new ones, she steadies herself, and launches the app. As it turns out, this app is exactly what the hamsterkitten community needed, and it surges to the top of the various app stores in mere hours. Jill goes to sleep that night confident that if any real security issues do pop up, she&#8217;s well-equipped to handle them, and the WordPress security team has her back.</p>\n<h3>Joe, A Server Administrator</h3>\n<p>Joe&#8217;s your regular sysops admin and developer, currently working with a Big Media organization to get their site up and running. He&#8217;s been paranoid about security ever since he left his laptop open at a conference and his colleagues made it yell his name every hour.</p>\n<p>The Big Media organization he&#8217;s working with wants to lock down the site to just a few applications, including their own custom one. Joe totally understands this, so he turns off the automatic client registration on the site. This stops the site from automatically creating credentials for clients registered on WordPress.org, and instead requires manual admin approval.</p>\n<p>He sets up the clients that the organization wants to use (including Kitstergram, Jill&#8217;s app) by running through the WordPress.org process and approving the clients with his administrator account. He then also manually sets up the client credentials for their custom app.</p>\n<p>He goes to bed that night knowing that the site and client are safe. If any problem pops up with Kitstergram, WordPress.org will handle the security for him, meaning he only needs to take care of the custom app security. Well, and his pet hamsterkitten.</p>\n<h3>Jenny, A Theme Developer</h3>\n<p>Themes have improved immensely in the past few years, with Jenny leading the charge through her theme company BooThemes. (As it turns out, spooky themes have really taken off in the past few years.) She&#8217;s been working on super-fast and immersive themes using the API.</p>\n<p>Some of the features that Jenny&#8217;s really proud of in her themes include live commenting and offline reading support. She also sells premium add-ons for bbPress and BuddyPress, which add tonnes of extra live features using their APIs.</p>\n<p>Despite writing themes that need to work across all the sites she interacts with, Jenny doesn&#8217;t worry about compatibility. Since the API is backwards compatible, she writes code for the latest version of WordPress and has it just work. She&#8217;s confident that any bugs will be fixed in the normal WordPress update process. Plus, having the API as part of WordPress core means she doesn&#8217;t have to worry about having her users run through a complex install process.</p>\n<h3>Ryan, An API Developer</h3>\n<p>After many years of working on the API, Ryan&#8217;s pleased that it&#8217;s finally been merged into core. Although it took a lot of hard work, it was worth all the effort after all. He now spends his time not worrying about which release of WordPress the API is going to be merged into.</p>\n<p>Of course, all these scenarios are just in Ryan&#8217;s head. He can be a little crazy at times. He can dream though, right?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 20 Jun 2015 02:02:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Ryan McCue";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"WPTavern: WordPress.tv is Branching Out Into Beginner Tutorial Videos";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45264";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-tv-is-branching-out-into-beginner-tutorial-videos";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4299:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wordpress-tv.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wordpress-tv.png?resize=1025%2C440" alt="wordpress-tv" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45425" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.tv/" target="_blank">WordPress.tv</a> is expanding its video catalog beyond WordCamp session recordings. As most of the video content on the site centers around topics for developers and established users, the WPTV team is now <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/06/16/do-you-screencast-or-make-video-tutorials-of-how-to-use-wordpress-wordpress-tv-wants-you/" target="_blank">actively soliciting submissions</a> for more beginner video tutorials.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Are you a proud member of the WordPress community, who creates (or would like to create) videos that are focused on helping others learn how to use WordPress? If you answered “yes” then we would love your help in submitting your videos to WordPress.tv, so we can share them with the world in our “how to” section.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The current &#8220;<a href="http://wordpress.tv/category/how-to/" target="_blank">how-to</a>&#8221; category on the site contains mostly outdated videos, featuring ancient versions of WordPress. The WPTV team is hoping to add more &#8220;getting started&#8221; content that covers basic WordPress site management, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to configure widgets</li>\n<li>Setting up a custom menu</li>\n<li>Managing comments</li>\n<li>How to insert an image gallery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The initiative to add more beginner content is not new but failed to gain traction in previous attempts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Uptake was slow, so we thought it would be a good idea to give it a go again, and put a bit more structure to it,&#8221; WPTV contributor Jerry Bates said.</p>\n<p>One guideline in particular that was a sticking point the last time the group solicited tutorials was the requirement of no self-promotion or logos in the videos. Contributors have to submit their work for sheer love of the community, which makes it more difficult to gather submissions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>While we want you to be able to benefit from your work, WordPress.tv is a non-commercial community-run website; we can’t accept videos with watermarks, logos, or self-promotion of any kind. We do have a place for you to enter your WordPress.org profile name as a producer credit, so you will get noticed!</p></blockquote>\n<p>So far, the WPTV team has not received many submissions, but the demand for beginner content is there. According to Bates, some of the most viewed videos are consistently the beginner tutorials, despite the fact that they are outdated.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a popular video type on YouTube and in for-pay training courses, but I think the greatest need is for foundation-level videos,&#8221; Bates said. &#8220;Anything that would help a new user on day one, week one, etc.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need more short and to-the-point tutorials,&#8221; WPTV crew member Michael Wiginton said. &#8220;Most will not want to watch a 45 minute video when trying to find an answer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team is also experimenting with a plugin that would bring these tutorial videos into the WordPress dashboard, but the first step is to build a library of suitable beginner content.</p>\n<p>WordCamp recordings provide a never-ending funnel of content down to WordPress.tv, but only a small slice of these videos are useful for beginners. If WordPress is going to continue to grow its marketshare, the project cannot depend on only providing developer-oriented videos and education.

The five-day drip content course is suitable for both plugin and theme developers and begins with instructions on how to structure your projects for an efficient Git workflow.</p>\n<p>While Git has many advanced features that could be overwhelming for beginners, the WP Git Crash Course only covers the ones that are directly relevant to WordPress development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Overall, this course has two purposes,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;First of all, it is a way for me to establish a connection with visitors of my website who stop by without downloading WP Pusher.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Secondly, some people arrive on my website and like what they see but are not quite ready to start using WP Pusher because they need more knowledge about Git in order to get started. The course should get them up to speed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As Suhm&#8217;s WP Pusher product manages <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-pusher-aims-to-provide-pain-free-deployment-of-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-from-github" target="_blank">deployment of WordPress themes and plugins from GitHub</a>, Git educational resources are a natural extension of his work.</p>\n<p>The crash course introduces Suhm&#8217;s recommended workflow but doesn&#8217;t force the user into a rigid method of structuring projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have concluded that maybe it is okay that people do things differently than me (but please do not keep your whole WordPress installation under version control!),&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I launched WP Pusher it was very opinionated and only supported my way of keeping WordPress under version control. Today it is much more flexible and works even if you keep multiple plugins or themes in one repository &#8211; something I would have sworn to never support.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Suhm is passionate about development best practices and workflow and often <a href="http://blog.wppusher.com/" target="_blank">blogs on these topics</a>. As a newcomer to the WordPress community, he offers a unique perspective.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the Laravel community, we see many new arrivals of people from the world of WordPress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For me it is the opposite. I am reentering the WordPress community after years of working with Laravel and Symfony, and I actually think I can bring something new to the table.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Aside from freelance work he did years ago, WP Pusher is Suhm&#8217;s first real venture into the WordPress world. After just five months, he&#8217;s pleased with how well his plugin has been received.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have been lucky enough to meet a lot of great people in the WordPress community, both IRL and online,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some of them have been extremely supportive and generously shared their experiences with me, which has really given me a head start.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Suhm is determined to keep creating educational content for the WordPress community and will be running the Git crash course for as long as people are interested. The course is not a complete, extensive guide to Git, as it just touches the surface. He plans to update it to add more advanced topics once he receives more feedback.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re just getting started integrating Git into your workflow for WordPress development, this crash course is a handy, concise resource for getting up to speed.

The WordPress community and the tech industry in general are <a href="http://wptavern.com/a-glimpse-into-serbias-rapidly-growing-wordpress-community" target="_blank">growing in the Balkans</a>. A large contingency of Croatian WordPress enthusiasts were present at neighboring <a href="http://wptavern.com/belgrades-first-wordcamp-sells-out-plans-to-double-attendees-next-year" target="_blank">Serbia&#8217;s first WordCamp in Belgrade</a> earlier this year. The <a href="http://wpcroatia.com/" target="_blank">Croatian WP community</a> has now grown large enough to host its own event.</p>\n<p>WordPress didn&#8217;t start gaining popularity in Croatia until 2013, but the country is now home to four thriving WordPress meetups in Zagreb, Split, Pula, and Rijeka. Local organizers decided to band together to apply for a country-wide WordCamp, instead of dividing it into smaller ones. They plan to rotate the location every year.</p>\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijeka" target="_blank">Rijeka</a>, the first host for WordCamp Croatia, is a multicultural city nestled on the Adriatic coast near Slovenia and Italy. It is well connected to nearby European capitals by air and train. Organizers are hoping to cultivate a &#8220;cozy and family–like atmosphere&#8221; for the event. <a href="http://business.croatia.hr/hr-HR/Poslovni-turizam/Kongresni-centri/Mjesto/Rijeka/Kongresni-centar/Hrvatski-kulturni-dom-na-Susaku?bGNcNDc0NjUscFwzODQ%3D" target="_blank">HKD Sušak</a>, the venue selected, has a capacity for up to 300 attendees.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Croatia will be a three-day event that will include educational workshops and tracks on Friday, the full conference on Saturday, and a Contributor Day on Sunday. The <a href="https://croatia.wordcamp.org/2015/call-for-speakers/" target="_blank">call for speakers</a> is open as of today and the deadline for proposals is July 5. Organizers will be accepting presentations in both English and Croatian.

Navigation in the app has been redesigned to remove the the hamburger button in favor of four simplified tabs spanning the top of the screen.</p>\n<p>The ubiquitous hamburger icon, used on apps and websites for years, is slowly <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/24/before-the-hamburger-button-kills-you/" target="_blank">falling out of fashion</a> on the web. While the side navigation drawer does a good job of keeping nav items out of sight, <a href="https://lmjabreu.com/post/why-and-how-to-avoid-hamburger-menus/" target="_blank">it comes at the cost of user engagement</a>. Hamburger menus are also inconvenient for one-handed device operation.</p>\n<p>Version 4.1 of WordPress for Android has been redesigned to display a tabbed action bar with quick access to your sites, the reader, user account settings, and notifications. The sites menu will allow you to manage any of your connected sites and includes a short menu for publishing, stats, theme customization, and access to the full dashboard.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tag-autocompletion.png"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tag-autocompletion.png?resize=219%2C300" alt="tag-autocompletion" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-45367" /></a>Another new feature in 4.1 is tag auto-completion. When adding a tag on the post settings screen, users will now receive suggestions (based on existing tags) while typing.</p>\n<p>Stats have also been improved to provide a noticeably faster viewing experience. The app now takes just a fraction of the time it previously required to load stats data. Interacting with this feature no longer feels like visiting a foreign land.</p>\n<p>Overall the 4.1 release is a big leap forward for WordPress&#8217; usability on Android. The navigation redesign is more intuitive and smaller features are continuing to be refined with each release. The 4.1 update should have already hit devices, so Android users can open up the app to check out everything that&#8217;s new.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 17:23:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"Matt: $3 Websites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45159";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://ma.tt/2015/06/3-websites/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:772:"<blockquote><p>And remember the $5 billion website, 5 billion we spent on a website, and to this day it doesn’t work.

Whether that means taking backwards compatibility into account or not has yet to be seen.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;It would probably be better to start from scratch; it’s not even close to up to date with current WP code it was meant to emulate,&#8221; Matt Mullenweg said in response to the idea. &#8220;It’s a fun experiment regardless, especially if people don’t think of it as Official WordPress Policy or Future (which it isn’t).&#8221;</p>\n<p>After nearly three hours of discussion about possible ways forward, those present concluded that it would be best to reconvene next week to identify the problems that BackPress would solve. Most of those in attendance were developers passionate about creating a more flexible, modular WordPress and willing to see if a BackPress revival could be a possibility for addressing that.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our conversation touched on the high level and next steps are coming, and we are planning on meeting next week same day, at 2PM (PST)</p>\n<p>&mdash; Roy Sivan (@royboy789) <a href="https://twitter.com/royboy789/status/610943668388802560">June 16, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Organizers created a<a href="https://github.com/royboy789/helium" target="_blank"> GitHub repository for exploring a new BackPress</a> and will meet every Tuesday at 2PM PST.

Following an overwhelming amount of negative feedback from the community, core contributors <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-contributors-call-for-user-testing-on-the-menu-customizer-plugin" target="_blank">published what was essentially a rallying call to get the plugin ready for merge</a>, reaffirming their commitment to iterating with the customizer.</p>\n<p>Nick Halsey, the plugin&#8217;s developer, published a number of <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/flow/2015/06/14/menus-in-the-admin-and-the-customizer-ux-flow-performance-comparisons/" target="_blank">UX flow and performance comparisons</a> of the admin menus screen vs. menus in the customizer.

I ran into a few areas where the experience could be improved, but in terms of timing, the Customizer version wins in most of these scenarios currently. Note that this is intended to compare the experience for power users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Menu Customizer is one of the most controversial new features added to core in WordPress&#8217; recent history. It will be interesting to see how it plays out when users discover it in 4.3. Those who were not in favor of the feature voiced their opposition in comments on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/06/03/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-menu-customizer/" target="_blank">original proposal</a> and in independent blogs around the web but were ultimately overruled.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Decisions not options: duplicate the interfaces, bringing complex things into little panels &amp; containers.

He&#8217;s also building the plugin as part of his day job, so it&#8217;s being developed with several different audiences in mind.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Using the REST API was super important because we&#8217;re searching on &#8216;keyup&#8217; and if that went through admin-ajax.php then shared hosts would likely melt down,&#8221; Haskins said. &#8220;So because it&#8217;s all client-side, it&#8217;s super lightweight and anything can run it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The feature is already built into Lasso but will not be released until Haskins has the chance to gather more feedback.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m interested to see HOW users search, is the search too fast, is it too slow, etc.,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All of this will lead to a perfect search feature inside of Lasso.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Haskins was previously hesitant to utilize the WP REST API before it has landed in WordPress core but the recent progress and momentum on the project inspired him to go for it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was avoiding the REST API, but with a tentative merge this fall, and V2 going out, I think the time is ripe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In using the REST API, I&#8217;ve learned that it&#8217;s very use case dependent and is really just another tool. There&#8217;s a time and place for it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WP Live Search is still under active development and may not be suitable for use in production just yet, but is functional and ready for testing. Here&#8217;s how to take it for a spin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Install <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-search-live/" target="_blank">WP Live Search</a>.</li>\n<li>Install the official <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/" target="_blank">WP REST API</a> plugin.</li>\n<li>Add the shortcode [wp_live_search] to a page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The shortcode accepts a few attributes, including type, placeholder, results, and target. More details are available on the plugin&#8217;s description <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-search-live/" target="_blank">page</a>.</p>\n<p>Haskins plans to add support for custom post types in the next major update to the plugin.

They will be discussing their plans to bring it back to life on a live Google Hangout at 1PM PST (8pm UTC) today, June 16.</p>\n<p>BackPress is a PHP library of core functionality for web applications. It essentially provides the core of bbPress and powers the GlotPress application, which enables WordPress, BuddyPress, and bbPress to be translated into different languages.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that bbPress project lead John James Jacoby is an ardent fan of BackPress, but few could have predicted that the project would be making a come back. In Sivan&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/970129579715923/" target="_blank">announcement</a> in the Advanced WordPress Facebook group, he briefly outlined their intentions for BackPress&#8217; future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>After a few conversations at WordCamp Miami, we both want to bring it back. My vision is for it to be up to date with current WP, and for it to be the WP you install when you don&#8217;t want the Dashboard, but to build something from scratch using modules / plugins.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Commenters responded positively to the announcement and Sivan and Jacoby plan to open the project up to contributors in the near future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The current state of BackPress is a mess,&#8221; Sivan said. &#8220;Unfortunately, it can&#8217;t be just overwritten, so our main goal is to talk action plan, how to get it to a place that is more up to date, then start adding modularity to it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My vision is you still get the easy installer, but things like wp-admin are just modules, and even modular within that per UI, but that shall be discussed as we move forward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Once the BackPress code is up to date, the duo hope to turn it into a usable starting point for application development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This + JSON REST API could be the next evolution of WordPress for developers,&#8221; Sivan said.</p>\n<p>For more details on the history of BackPress, check out Jeff Chandler&#8217;s 2010 <a href="http://wptavern.com/interview-with-beau-lebens-talking-backpress" target="_blank">interview with Beau Lebens</a>.

Founder Jason Lemieux and his team launched the <a href="http://wptavern.com/postmatic-launches-100-email-based-commenting-for-wordpress" target="_blank">100% email-based commenting service</a> in April and have been steadily adding importers for users of other various comment subscription plugins. Postmatic launched with importers for Mailpoet, Mailchimp, and <a href="http://wptavern.com/postmatic-now-supports-1-click-migration-of-subscribers-from-jetpack" target="_blank">one-click migration of subscribers from Jetpack</a>.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/subscribe-to-comments/" target="_blank">Subscribe to Comments</a> is a popular old plugin created by Mark Jaquith and is currently in use on 80,000+ installations. The plugin hasn&#8217;t been updated for more than two years and many users in its <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/subscribe-to-comments" target="_blank">support forums</a> are eagerly looking for an alternative.</p>\n<p>With over 80,000 sites depending on an older, unmaintained plugin, Lemieux and his team saw a ripe opportunity to create an importer to fill the gap. Subscribe to Comments users can conveniently migrate with one click:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’ve built a new migration tool into Postmatic 1.2.3 which will allow Subscribe to Comments users to convert their legacy subscribers into shiny new Postmatic subscribers. It all happens with just one click, invisibly, in the background. From then on out notifications of new comments will be sent to old subscribers except this time they’ll be able to continue the conversation by just hitting reply.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The migration tool also works with variations of Subscribe to Comments, including <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/subscribe-to-comments-reloaded/" target="_blank">Subscribe to Comments Reloaded</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/subscribe-to-double-opt-in-comments/" target="_blank">Subscribe to Double-Opt-In Comments</a>. The importer is another strategic addition that will likely win Postmatic more new users.</p>\n<p>Postmatic is aiming to become a big player in WordPress comments and is continuing to build out more products centered around enhancing engagement. In addition to expanding the user base of the free Postmatic plugin, the team is also busy beta testing Epoch, its next major release. Epoch is currently <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/epoch/" target="_blank">available on WordPress.org</a> and aims to bring 100% realtime chat and commenting to WordPress&#8217; native commenting system. Keep your eyes on the Postmatic team in the coming days, as they ready their next round of innovations.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 22:57:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"WPTavern: o2 is Now Available on GitHub";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45188";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"http://wptavern.com/o2-is-now-available-on-github";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3618:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/o2-on-github.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/o2-on-github.png?resize=1025%2C536" alt="o2-on-github" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45205" /></a></p>\n<p>This weekend at WordCamp Denver, <a href="https://twitter.com/alternatekev" target="_blank">Kevin Conboy</a> announced that Automattic&#8217;s <a href="http://wptavern.com/o2-wordpress-plugin-expected-to-be-available-in-early-2014" target="_blank">long-awaited O2 project</a> is now publicly <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/o2" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a>. In a recent interview with WP Tavern, Matt Mullenweg confirmed that the o2 development team is <a href="http://wptavern.com/o2-development-team-shifts-focus-to-wordpress-coms-core-products" target="_blank">shifting its focus to WordPress.com&#8217;s core products</a> but that the o2 code would be public for anyone to use.</p>\n<p>o2 was is the successor to <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/p2/" target="_blank">P2</a>, the innovative group blogging theme created to power communications at Automattic. P2 was <a href="http://wptavern.com/p2-officially-on-the-theme-repository" target="_blank">released in 2009</a> with the tagline &#8220;Blogging at the speed of thought.&#8221; It introduced quick posting from the front page and real-time updates.</p>\n<p>o2 shares P2&#8217;s tagline but, unlike its predecessor, it was created to be a plugin that is not dependent on a specific theme.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/devinsays">@devinsays</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelarestad">@michaelarestad</a> that''s the theory!</p>\n<p>&mdash; Kevin Conboy (@alternatekev) <a href="https://twitter.com/alternatekev/status/610413606446825473">June 15, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, it&#8217;s not guaranteed to work with any theme, so if you want the best experience you should test it out with the <a href="https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/p2-breathe" target="_blank">p2-breathe theme</a>, as recommended in the GitHub installation instructions. o2 requires the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/genericond/" target="_blank">Genericon&#8217;d</a> plugin and if you want the ability to insert code blocks, it requires the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/" target="_blank">SyntaxHighlighter Evolved</a> plugin.</p>\n<p>The readme.txt on GitHub cautions that &#8220;multisite self-hosted installs have not yet been tested and may not work.&#8221; Although the plugin was written to shine within a network environment with cross-site search and cross-site posting, the network features are not guaranteed to work for self-hosted users.

Okay, fine. Here are my favorite parts:</p>\n<h3>Where is code?</h3>\n<p>While the entire article answers, &#8220;What is code?&#8221;, he starts by answering, &#8220;Where is code?&#8221; Code is much broader than the web. It&#8217;s pervasive. Everywhere.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most programmers aren’t working on building a widely recognized application like Microsoft Word. Software is everywhere. It’s gone from a craft of fragile, built-from-scratch custom projects to an industry of standardized parts, where coders absorb and improve upon the labors of their forebears (even if those forebears are one cubicle over). Software is there when you switch channels and your cable box shows you what else is on. You get money from an ATM—software. An elevator takes you up five stories—the same. Facebook releases software every day to something like a billion people, and that software runs inside Web browsers and mobile applications. Facebook looks like it’s just pictures of your mom’s crocuses or your son’s school play—but no, it’s software.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Computers are dumb</h3>\n<p><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html">Until they&#8217;re not</a>. But today, computers really don&#8217;t know anything; they return things based on what we put in them, and they can do so many things faster than we can.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every character truly, truly matters. Every single stupid misplaced semicolon, space where you meant tab, bracket instead of a parenthesis—mistakes can leave the computer in a state of panic. The trees don’t know where to put their leaves. Their roots decay. The boxes don’t stack neatly. For not only are computers as dumb as a billion marbles, they’re also positively Stradivarian in their delicacy.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Programming languages</h3>\n<p>Paul spends a ton of time talking about various programming languages, their origins, their styles, their adoptions, their usefulness, and how they&#8217;ve evolved.</p>\n<p>He primarily focuses on C (and how it&#8217;s fast but not object oriented) and Java (and how it&#8217;s object oriented but not fast, relatively). Amazingly, he manages to talk about many, many languages, their attributes, and yet explain them in a way that nearly anyone can understand.</p>\n<p>I have to admit something: I am so far from a classically trained developer that I found this focus of the article to be incredibly educational. I learned the wrong way, from the tip of the pyramid down. If you consider markup and styles the very tip, and then WordPress is a bit below that as a framework for PHP &#8212; and you are still only part way down the pyramid. PHP is built with C and C compiles to machine code. His article helped me understand the pyramid from the other direction much better.</p>\n<h3>Programmer culture</h3>\n<p>An important piece of the article was around culture. He spends time both on programmer attitudes and broader programming culture, such as conferences.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Languages have agendas. People glom onto them. Blunt talk is seen as a good quality in a developer, a sign of an “engineering mindset”—spit out every opinion as quickly as possible, the sooner to reach a technical consensus. Expect to be told you’re wrong; expect to tell other people they’re wrong. (Masculine anger, bluntly expressed, is part of the industry.)</p>\n<p>Coding is a culture of blurters. This can yield fast decisions, but it penalizes people who need to quietly compose their thoughts, rewarding fast-twitch thinkers who harrumph efficiently. Programmer job interviews, which often include abstract and meaningless questions that must be answered immediately on a whiteboard, typify this culture. Regular meetings can become sniping matches about things that don’t matter. The shorthand term for that is “bikeshedding.” (Who cares what color the bike shed is painted? Well …)</p>\n<p>Code culture is very, very broad, but the geographic and cultural core is the Silicon Valley engine of progress. The Valley mythologizes young geniuses with vast sums. To its credit, this culture works; to its shame, it doesn’t work for everyone.</p>\n<p>At any moment some new thing could catch fire and disrupt the tribal ebb and flow. Instagram was written in Python and sold for $2 billion, so Python had a moment of glory. The next mind-blowing app could show up, written in some new language—and start everyone taking that more seriously. Within 18 months your skills could be, if not quite valueless, suspect.</p>\n<p>I was in a meeting once where someone said, “How long will it take to fix that?” One person, who’d been at the company for years, said, “Three months.” A new person, who’d just come from a world of rapidly provisioned cloud microservices, said, “Three minutes.” They were both correct. That’s how change enters into this world. Slowly at first, then on the front page of Hacker News.</p>\n<p>Programmers carve out a sliver of cognitive territory for themselves and go to conferences, and yet they know their position is vulnerable. They get defensive when they hear someone suggest that Python is better than Ruby, because [insert 500-comment message thread here]. Is the next great wave swelling somewhere, and will it wash away Java when it comes? Will Go conquer Python? Do I need to learn JavaScript to remain profitable? Programmers are often angry because they’re often scared. We are, most of us, stumbling around with only a few candles to guide the way. We can’t always see the whole system, so we need to puzzle it out, bit by bit, in the dark.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And his passage on the decreasing percentages of female coders is pure perfection:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The average programmer is moderately diligent, capable of basic mathematics, has a working knowledge of one or more programming languages, and can communicate what he or she is doing to management and his or her peers. Given that a significant number of women work as journalists and editors, perform surgery, run companies, manage small businesses, and use spreadsheets, that a few even serve on the Supreme Court, and that we are no longer surprised to find women working as accountants, professors, statisticians, or project managers, it’s hard to imagine that they can’t write JavaScript. Programming, despite the hype and the self-serving fantasies of programmers the world over, isn’t the most intellectually demanding task imaginable.</p>\n<p>Which leads one to the inescapable conclusion: The problem with women in technology isn’t the women.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>PHP and (sorta) WordPress</h3>\n<p>Of everything discussed in the article, the one thing I really could tell he didn&#8217;t appreciate much was PHP.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You can get a site up and running in PHP in a few minutes, and that’s the problem. It used to be the terrible choice you made when you needed to get something done on the Web, but increasingly JavaScript has replaced it as the default terrible choice.</p>\n<p>PHP stands for Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter. The idea was that when you loaded your Web pages, the PHP code would run before the page went out to the Internet. And PHP could, say, check whether you were logged in. If you were, it could show you your top secret account details; and if you weren’t, it could say, “Please log in.”</p>\n<p>I know a lot of people who program in PHP, and they are smart, good people. PHP powers Etsy and Facebook. It powers Wikipedia, for God’s sake. WordPress. Out of all the Web’s pages, an enormous percentage is created with PHP.</p>\n<p>Coding in PHP for a living is not a death sentence. Lots of people have gotten rich off PHP. It just means a lot of cutting and pasting, and a lot of trips to Google to figure out why things aren’t working.</p>\n<p>Poor, sad, misbegotten, incredibly effective, massively successful PHP. Reading PHP code is like reading poetry, the poetry you wrote freshman year of college.</p>\n<p>I spent so many hundreds, maybe thousands, of hours programming in PHP, back when I didn’t know what I was doing and neither did PHP. Reloading Web pages until my fingers were sore. (I can hear your sympathetic sobs.) Everything was always broken, and people were always hacking into my sites.</p>\n<p>PHP. I don’t wish it any harm. I’m glad to see how well it’s done for itself. We had some good times together. I just don’t ever want to go back there.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He also uses WordPress as the punching bag for the story in the story. The fictional story within the article is of a company that&#8217;s replacing their current website with a new website. It&#8217;s a big corporate environment and they&#8217;re, &#8220;at the limits with WordPress.&#8221; Of course, <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/06/paul-ford-what-is-code-bloomberg/">Matt Mullenweg took issue</a> with that one aspect on his own blog.</p>\n<h3>Debugging, testing, and version control</h3>\n<p>Paul gives some of the best layman&#8217;s descriptions for debugging, testing, and version control I&#8217;ve ever read. He closes the section with this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>See, tests and version control are now the trigger for actually shipping code. If you can follow a process like this, you can release software several times a day—which in the days of shrink-wrapped software would have been folly. (Often builds were done nightly, by big “build servers,” and one would come in the next morning to get the score.) But now that software can be released via the Web or an app store, why wait? Why not continually release software, every day, whenever you have something that’s ready to go?</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Actually picking a language</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to limit this one and it was one of my favorite parts, so I&#8217;m just going to toss it in in bulk.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Beware of arguments related to programming speed. All things being equal, faster is better. But all things are never equal. Do you need the kind of speed that lets you get a website up and running quickly? Or the kind that allows you to rotate a few thousand polygons in 3D in real time? Do you need to convert 10,000 PDFs into text per hour? Or 10 million PDFs into text once? These are different problems. What do we need to do, how many times do we need to do it, and what existing code can we use to help us do it that many times? Ask those questions.</p>\n<p>It’s possible to spend productive months preparing for a project without deciding on a language. It may be the sign of a fine manager, someone who assumes his people can learn new things, someone who’s built an agile team capable of experimenting with new technologies and getting ideas into production. It could also be that this person is totally useless. You’ll find out!</p>\n<p>Let’s say your programmers are developing a huge website that serves 5 million people who each visit five times a month. Do you use Python, which is slower, or Go, which is fast, or Node.js, which is something in-between? Trick question! Twenty-five million Web page visits isn’t that big a deal, unless they involve some deep wizardry or complex database queries that are very different for each page (good example: Facebook).</p>\n<p>Now, that number isn’t trivial; if it takes a minute to make a page, you’d need 48 years to make that many, which is way too slow. If it takes a second to make a page, that’s still too slow—there are only 2.6 million seconds in a month. So you need to figure out how to serve about 10 pages per second. You’ll probably want more than one computer, a little redundancy, some good server setup. It will take some doing and planning. But it can be done in any language.</p>\n<p>What if you are going to serve only a few hundred thousand pages a month? Then you’ve got tremendous breathing room. You don’t need too many engineers to create the system architecture. You still need to plan, but in general you can read some blog posts and follow along with what others have done. You can be pretty sloppy, to be honest. Again, any language will do.</p>\n<p>What if you want to include a live, person-to-person chat on those pages, and you expect thousands of people to use that chat at once, all speaking to each other? Now you’re dipping your hand into that godforsaken river. But that is exactly the problem that Go was designed to solve. It’s a language for creating highly available servers that use as much of the computer’s processor as possible. It has other features as well, but this is where Go shines. Actually, Node.js works pretty well for that sort of server, too, and Clojure certainly has the capacity. Oh, right, Java works, too. If you really needed to, you could even do it in PHP.</p>\n<p>This is why the choice is so hard. Everything can do everything, and people will tell you that you should use everything to do everything. So you need to figure out for yourself what kind of team you have, what kind of frameworks you like using, where people can be most productive, so they will stick around through the completion of the project. This is hard. Most places can’t do this. So they go with the lowest common denominator—Java, PHP—because they know that when people leave, they’ll be able to get more of them.</p>\n<p>And that’s OK. The vast majority of technology projects don’t require original research, nor do they require amazing technological discoveries. All the languages under discussion work just fine. There are great coders in all of them.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Should you learn to code?</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve only highlighted some of my favorite parts.

While there are already hundreds of lightbox plugins available for WordPress, this one may prove to be the &#8220;lightest&#8221; of them all.</p>\n<p>The plugin is essentially a wrapper for the <a href="http://noelboss.github.io/featherlight/" target="_blank">Featherlight jQuery lightbox script</a> created by Noel Bossart. Featherlight.js was designed to be very lightweight and is just 400 lines of JavaScript, 100 of CSS, and less than 6kB combined. It works on IE8+, all modern browsers, and on mobile platforms. The script is responsive and supports images, ajax, and iframes out of the box.</p>\n<p>WP Featherlight solves a number of problems that WordPress users often encounter with lightbox plugins, many of which contain a load of heavy-handed styling that is difficult to override.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We were having a really hard time finding a lightbox plugin that was simple to customize, but that was also lightweight, flexible, and didn’t add a bunch of bloat to our website,&#8221; WP Site Care founder Ryan Sullivan said in his <a href="http://www.wpsitecare.com/wp-featherlight/" target="_blank">post</a> introducing the plugin.</p>\n<p>The WP Site Care team opted to build their own solution on top of Featherlight.js. The resulting plugin provides a fast, minimalist style popup for images and galleries.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-featherlight-screenshot.png"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wp-featherlight-screenshot.png?resize=1025%2C786" alt="wp-featherlight-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45168" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin includes built-in support for native WordPress galleries and <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/tiled-galleries/" target="_blank">Jetpack galleries</a>. When you install it, there are no options to configure. It will automatically display all images and galleries in a lightbox. If you <a href="https://github.com/noelboss/featherlight/#usage" target="_blank">add some extra data attributes to your content</a>, it&#8217;s also possible to display videos, iframes, and ajax content with WP Featherlight.</p>\n<p>The demo video below shows how the plugin works with galleries to click from one image to the next while in the lightbox.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>One common problem with WordPress lightbox plugins is that they usually load their scripts and styles on every page, whether you need the lightbox there or not. WP Featherlight gives you the option in the post editor to disable the lightbox. It&#8217;s a handy option to have in case you don&#8217;t want to load a larger version of your images on that particular post/page, but I&#8217;m not sure why you wouldn&#8217;t just conditionally load the scripts on pages that have images.</p>\n<p>I tested WP Featherlight on a demo site and found that it works as advertised. You would be hard pressed to find a leaner lightbox plugin for WordPress. The style is super minimal and the fact that there are no options to configure makes it a pleasure to use. Many thanks to <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/fatmedia/" target="_blank">Robert Neu</a> and the folks at WP Site Care for making it freely <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-featherlight/" target="_blank">available on WordPress.org</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 19:36:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"WPTavern: WordPress Plugin Developers Need to Communicate Better in Change Logs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45107";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-developers-need-to-communicate-better-in-change-logs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4839:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CommunicationFeaturedImage.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-15569" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/CommunicationFeaturedImage.jpg?resize=637%2C200" alt="Communication Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elycefeliz/3224486233/">elycefeliz</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>One of the habits I developed when I started using WordPress is to <strong>always</strong> read a plugin&#8217;s changelog before updating. The changelog is a communication channel that bridges the gap between me and the developer.</p>\n<p>It tells me what&#8217;s changed, what to expect, and any other information the developer thinks I should know. The most important information a developer can tell me is that a security vulnerability has been addressed.</p>\n<p>Security vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins generally receive a decent amount of media coverage. If I read a story that mentions a plugin I use containing a vulnerability, the first thing I do is visit that plugin&#8217;s changelog on the WordPress plugin directory to see if it&#8217;s fixed. However, some plugin authors don&#8217;t do a very good job of informing users that a security patch has been applied.</p>\n<h2>WooCommerce and VaultPress</h2>\n<p>WooCommerce recently <a href="http://wptavern.com/woocommerce-2-3-11-patches-object-injection-vulnerability">released an update</a> to fix an object injection vulnerability. If you look at the changelog for 2.3.11 which has the patch, there is no mention of a security vulnerability being fixed.</p>\n<h4>2.3.11 &#8211; 10/06/2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Check if rating is enabled before check if rating is required to a review.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; get_discounted_price needs to check if taxes are enabled.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Fixed filetype check for digital downloads.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Newfoundland and Labrador state rename.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Escaped js in widget layered nav when use the dropdown option.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Switch the permissions check for json_search_products to use the read_product capability.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Fixed the addition of variable products using the Order API.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Sale item exclusion logic for variations.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Clear correct variation stock transients when setting stock.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; Switch to JSON to avoid unserializing untrusted data when handling responses from PayPal.</li>\n<li>Fix &#8211; API &#8211; Fixed the sanitization for downloadable files on products endpoint.</li>\n<li>Tweak &#8211; woocommerce_downloadable_file_exists filter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To the untrained eye, 2.3.11 is just a regular maintenance release. Security fixes should be front and center and command attention.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/vaultpress/changelog/">VaultPress</a>, a security monitoring plugin by Automattic, also fails to provide clear information in its changelog. Determining security patches with VaultPress is confusing because security hotfixes are labeled as though they are patches for the plugin itself. Instead, security hotfixes are patches to protect from known security vulnerabilities.</p>\n<h4>1.7.5 &#8211; 11 Jun 2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Security: Add a new security hotfix.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.4 &#8211; 28 Apr 2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugfix: Don&#8217;t allow openssl signing unless the public key exists.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>1.7.3 &#8211; 27 Apr 2015</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Security: Add a new security hotfix.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To add to the confusion, there&#8217;s no explanation as to what the hotfixes protect against. You have to read the <a href="https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1178685/vaultpress">inline comment on GitHub</a> to know what the latest hotfix does.</p>\n<blockquote><p>// Protect WooCommerce from object injection via PayPal IPN notifications. Affects 2.0.20 -&gt; 2.3.10</p></blockquote>\n<p>If VaultPress developers added the comment from GitHub to the changelog on WordPress.org, it would have made things a lot clearer.</p>\n<h2>Users Read Change Logs</h2>\n<p>When we <a href="http://wptavern.com/poll-how-often-do-you-read-a-wordpress-plugins-changelog-before-updating">asked readers</a> how often do they read a plugin&#8217;s changelog before updating, 705 out of 1,152 voters said they <strong>always</strong> read it while 338 people said they <strong>sometimes</strong> read it. Whether they understand the changes or not, users read change logs.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a plugin developer, please consider adding context and clear explanations to your change logs. Clearly state what is a security patch, bug fix, or tweak. I don&#8217;t need to know the fine details, just enough information to make a good decision.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 19:12:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"WPTavern: HHVM Demonstrated to be 18.7% Faster Than PHP 7 on a WordPress Workload";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=45062";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"http://wptavern.com/hhvm-demonstrated-to-be-18-7-faster-than-php-7-on-a-wordpress-workload";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4072:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hhvmhack.png"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hhvmhack.png?resize=700%2C175" alt="hhvmhack" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22751" /></a></p>\n<p>This week HHVM developers shared the results of their first ever <a href="http://hhvm.com/blog/9293/lockdown-results-and-hhvm-performance" target="_blank">open source performance lockdown</a>. HHVM is Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hhvm" target="_blank">open source</a> PHP execution engine, originally created to help make its infrastructure more efficient. WordPress managed hosts, including <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-engine-partners-with-10up-to-launch-enterprise-hhvm-wordpress-hosting-platform" target="_blank">WP Engine</a>, <a href="https://pagely.com/blog/2014/06/run-hhvm-pagely/" target="_blank">Pagely</a>, and <a href="https://www.siteground.com/blog/hhvm/" target="_blank">SiteGround</a>, have added HHVM hosting options within the last year to cater to customers who require better PHP performance.</p>\n<p>During the HHVM team&#8217;s two week lockdown, developers focused on optimizing builtin functions, dynamic properties, string concatenation, and the file cache. The goal was to maximize requests per second (RPS) with WordPress, Drupal 7, and MediaWiki, using their <a href="https://github.com/hhvm/oss-performance" target="_blank">oss-performance</a> benchmarking tool.</p>\n<p>&#8220;During lockdown we achieved a 19.4% RPS improvement for MediaWiki workloads, and a 1.8% RPS improvement for WordPress,&#8221; Facebook developer Paul Bissonnette reported. &#8220;We demonstrated that HHVM is 55.5% faster than PHP 7 on a MediaWiki workload, <strong>18.7% faster on a WordPress workload</strong>, and 10.2% faster on a Drupal 7 workload.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These results were based on configuring each framework with a sample dataset designed to approximate an average installation. In order to create the WordPress workload, the HHVM team used URLs from the hhvm.com access logs to extract data.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://hhvm.com/blog/9293/lockdown-results-and-hhvm-performance" target="_blank">report</a> contains a walkthrough of how the benchmarking tool works to approximate the maximum possible RPS of a server under a high load. Some of the most notable performance differences were summarized in the results of the engine comparison chart, which demonstrates the difference between PHP 5, PHP 7, and HHVM.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/engine-comparison.png"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/engine-comparison.png?resize=1025%2C429" alt="engine-comparison" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-45141" /></a></p>\n<p>During the lockdown, the team also experimented with introducing asynchronous query execution to WordPress, the results of which the team plans to write about in the near future.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As an exercise, we evaluated the benefits of <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/tree/master/hphp/runtime/ext/async_mysql" target="_blank">async MySQL</a> in the WordPress environment. By modifying portions of WordPress to take advantage of the async capabilities offered by Hack and HHVM, we were able to examine the potential for performance gains through async execution. In our test environment we separated the MySQL and PHP hosting to separate machines within the same datacenter to approximate a realistic WordPress stack. The introduction of asynchronous query execution can demonstrate performance gains in both RPS and response time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It will be interesting to see a more detailed report of the benefits they found from introducing async capabilities to WordPress. Overall, the lockdown provided an opportunity for collaboration across open source projects, resulting in a host of optimizations that will help OS frameworks perform better with HHVM in the future. The HHVM team plans to ship these improvements with the next release.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 17:47:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:10:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 03:06:20 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"207529";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 02:45:17 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20150503060726";}', 'no');
